Welcome to the repository!

The code displayed here comprises HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that collectively form the user interface and client-side functionality for a social media website.

**File Overview:**

1. **HTML Files:**
   - `login-index.html`: contains the structure for the login page, including form elements for user authentication.
   - `main-index.html`: serves as the main page of the application, displaying the content of posts for an individual user with his own feed.

2. **CSS Files:**
   - `login-styles.css`: Styles specific to the login page, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly design.
   - `main-styles.css`: Contains styling rules for the main page (user-friendly as well).

3. **JavaScript Files:**
   - `login-script.js`: Handles client-side validation and interactions on the login page, such as form submissions and input validations.
   - `main-script.js`: Manages dynamic behaviors on the main page, including event handling and data manipulation.
   - `load-mainpage-data-script.js`: Responsible for fetching and loading data into the main page in a format of posts (header, date, body). Allows it through API calls or other data sources.
